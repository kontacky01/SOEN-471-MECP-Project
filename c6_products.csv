It has been used by the medical profession to treat over one million people worldwide. Wash your hands before use and then gently clean the scar and surrounding skin. Thoroughly dry the area before applying CICA-CARE. Peel the lid from the tray containing CICA-CARE and remove the gel sheet. With a pair of scissors, cut the sheet to the size of the scar - allowing a little overlap all the way round. Store the remaining gel sheet in a dry place, like the tray the gel came in. Remove the printed plastic sheet to reveal the adhesive. Apply CICA-CARE, adhesive side down, to the scarred area without stretching the strip. If your scar is in an awkward position you may wish to use a light bandage or tape to keep Cica-Care in position. Do not hold the gel sheet too tightly to the skin as this may cause irritation of the scar and surrounding area. CICA-CARE should be applied to the scar for 4 hours on the first two days of use. The application time should then be increased by 2 hours a day to enable your skin to get used to the gel strip. Clean CICA-CARE twice daily with a mild soap. Once you've cleaned the gel strip, rinse it well. Dry the CICA-CARE strip with a non-fluffy towel before re-applying. Ensure the scar and surrounding area is washed too.",SNW-66250706,78.99,https://c6.ca/collections/wound-care/products/smith-nephew-cica-care-adhesive-gel-sheet-for-scar-care-12cm-x-15cm-box-of-1,2024-03-18 16:29:11

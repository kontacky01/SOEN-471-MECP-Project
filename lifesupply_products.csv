Our easy-to-use OMRON 10 Series Wireless Upper Arm home blood pressure monitor (BP7450CAN) is powered by OMRON Advanced Accuracy technology, which measures five times more data points for more consistent, precise readings. This OMRON-exclusive technology minimizes the impact your breathing and movements will have on your blood pressure reading results, helping to reduce measurement inconsistencies and errors. The 10 Series Wireless Upper Arm Monitor features a horizontally designed, dual LCD monitor, which lets you immediately compare your current reading to your last reading, while the large, black, backlit side-by-side comparison display makes your readings easier to see. This premium blood pressure monitor stores 200 blood pressure readings for two users (100 per user), while the Advanced Averaging feature automatically displays the average of up to the last three readings taken within the last 10 minutes. Sync via Bluetooth to the free OMRON Connect app for unlimited memory, graphs and trend tracking, as well as unlimited users. The OMRON Connect app works with iOS and Android devices (visit OmronHealthcare.ca/service-and-support/connected-health/connected-device-compatibility for a list of compatible devices). It also works with Amazon Alexa-enabled devices using the OMRON Health skill. This monitor includes other OMRON exclusives such as an enhanced Irregular Heartbeat Symbol, which alerts you of the number of irregular heartbeats (up to three) while your blood pressure is being measured, and TruRead technology which, allows you to automatically take three consecutive readings at intervals you can customize (15 seconds, 30 seconds, 60 seconds, or the optimal two-minute rest period between readings) and displays the average. Additionally, the Hypertension Indicator feature displays a “HIGH” symbol if your systolic (upper) measurement reaches 130 mmHg or above, and/or if your diastolic (lower) measurement reaches 80 mmHg or above. With the monitor, you get the OMRON pre-formed ComFit cuff, which is designed to help reduce cuff placement and measurement errors, and fits arms from 9” to 17” (22-42 cm) in circumference.

Safety Syringe is the cornerstone of the Inviro Safety System. This breakthrough safety syringe was designed by a practicing nurse and surgeon to reduce the potential for needlesticks to healthcare workers. The unique product was engineered with the safety feature integral to its design, unlike most safety syringes that are retro-fitted using add-on pieces. The InviroSNAP! Safety Syringe takes sharps safety to the next level with a new category of safety syringe that bridges the gap between bulky retro-fitted models and more expensive automatic retractable syringes. Its revolutionary design as a manually retractable syringe places InviroSNAP! in a next generation product category all its own. The InviroSNAP! Safety Syringe is available in a comprehensive range of sizes (from 1 ml to 5 ml and 50 and 100 unit insulin syringes), with both fixed and exchangeable needles. The InviroSNAP! Safety Syringe may also be used with InviroLINK Vial Access Plastic Cannula, Inviro Medical's exchangeable cannula system.

It is ideally suited for hot/dusty work settings that require long periods of wear. 3M™ Particulate Respirator 8511, N95 is a disposable particulate respirator that is designed to help provide reliable respiratory protection of at least 95 percent filtration efficiency against certain non oil based particles. The respirator is designed for use for particles such as those from grinding, sanding, sweeping, sawing, bagging, or other dusty operations. This respirator can also help reduce inhalation exposures to certain airborne biological particles (examples: mold, Bacillus anthracis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), but cannot eliminate the risk of contracting infection, illness, or disease. Soft inner material provides added comfort while the cup shape design makes the respirator spacious and durable. Braided headbands and an adjustable M nose clip helps provide a custom and secure seal. The respirator incorporates 3M’s proprietary technology with advanced electrostatically charged microfiber filter media designed for ease of breathing. This respirator is compatible with a variety of protective eyewear and hearing protection. Fitted with a 3M Cool Flow™ Exhalation Valve, this respirator is ideally suited for work situations involving heat, humidity, or long periods of wear. The proprietary 3M Cool Flow valve is designed to release hot, humid exhaled breath quickly, helping to prevent an unpleasant build up of heat inside the facepiece a significant cause of discomfort to respirator wearers. The Cool Flow valve’s efficiency in keeping breathing cool and comfortable has been demonstrated through testing*: the atmosphere inside a respirator with a Cool Flow valve is on average 7.5°F cooler than the similar product without the valve. This makes Cool Flow valve respirators ideal for long periods of wear, especially where conditions are hot, humid or physically demanding.",3M-8511 BX,159.74,https://lifesupply.ca/3m-8511-54343-n95-particulate-respirator-mask-w-ext-valve-bx-10-bx/,2024-03-18 16:29:10

Variety of iFill Cylinders iFill provides the flexibility to fill most cylinder sizes including M4, M6, ML6, C, D and E, using the PulseDose Oxygen Conserving Device interface or Regulator interface. iFill cylinders are also available with a standard 870 Post Valve in sizes M4, M6, ML6, C and D for use with any conserving device or regulator. (Note: iFill must be used with an iFill Cylinder.) Competitive Performance iFill lets users fill their cylinders in just a little over an hour – not the two hours it can take with other in-home oxygen filling units. Shorter fill times save energy costs. Partially filled cylinders can be easily topped off. And the iFill will automatically shut off when filling is complete. Oxygen Supply Times Chart The chart below reflects the number of hours an oxygen-filled cylinder will last when used with a PulseDose® Conserving Device or a Continuous Flow Regulator. Note: All ambulatory ranges are calculated assuming a breath rate of 20 breaths per minute in PulseDose (PD) mode.",Drive Medical 535D,3442.01,https://lifesupply.ca/drive-medical-535d-devilbiss-ifill-personal-oxygen-station-k0738/,2024-03-18 16:29:10

Use with 3M™ Respirators 5000 Series or 3M™ Cartridges 6000 Series with 3M™ Adapter 502, 3M™ Facepieces 6000 Series, or 3M™ Facepieces 7000 Series with bayonet filter holders. The 3M™ Particulate Filter 7093, P100 helps provide respiratory protection against exposure to lead, asbestos, cadmium, arsenic, and MDA. The filter is effective for concentrations up to 10 times the Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) with half facepieces or 50 times PEL with quantitatively fit tested full facepieces when welding, brazing, torch cutting, metal pouring and soldering. This filter helps protect against a wide range of oil and non-oil based particulate contaminants. Inventory needs and training requirements of safety equipment are reduced because this filter works for many different applications. This P100 filter is designed to protect in higher-heat applications. An innovative solid-top air-inlet reduces premature loading by allowing a channeled airflow. Industries in which this filter is commonly used include abatement, agriculture, construction, general manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, primary metals and remediation. The filter works with a wide range of facepieces, including 3M™ Half and Full Facepieces 6000, 7000 and FF-400 Series. If used with 3M™ Adapter 502, the filter may also be used with 3M™ Respirator 5000 Series or 3M™ Cartridge 6000 Series. The filter is NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) approved for environments containing certain oil and non-oil based particles. The filter has been assigned the color code “magenta” in the NIOSH system. Passing NIOSH’s P-series test criteria, the 7093 P100 filter provides at least 99.97 percent filter efficiency against particles. Breathing hazardous particles can pose a risk to your health. NIOSH, a Federal government regulatory agency, has tested and approved the 3M™ Particulate Filter 7093 to help reduce exposure to certain particles.",3M 7093,11.60,https://lifesupply.ca/3m-7093-filter-p100-for-half-facepiece-each/,2024-03-18 16:29:10

The resilient fiber fill supports the head while the crescent shaped cutout contours the shoulder for a restful night's sleep. The CPAP Pillow is firm enough to support the head without losing its edge, yet comfortable enough to sleep on all night.

This pillow is ideal for side sleepers, back sleepers, and people who suffer from chronic headaches and neck pain.

The water chamber is removable to make filling it convenient and easy.

For convenient laundering, simply remove the water chamber and toss the pillow into washing machine. Easy-to-follow instructions can be found on the pillow's tag.

In addition to helping regulate your temperature, the Tri-Core Comfort Zone Pillow also helps provide proper alignment of the neck.

The rounded, segmented shape provides optimal stretch and targets painful areas. This roller helps relieve pain in 3 ways: stretch, cold therapy, and heat therapy. The most common symptoms of Plantar Fasciitis are stabbing, burning foot and/or heel pain. These symptoms are usually most intense when you first step out of bed or after long periods of rest. The Plantar F3 helps relieve plantar fasciitis and heel/foot pain three ways: 1. STRETCH: Roll back and forth under the foot to gently stretch the plantar fascia (the fibrous tissue along the bottom of the foot that connects the heel bone (calcaneus) to toes). Stretching the plantar fascia prior to placing weight on it helps prevent damage and micro tears to the tissue. 2. COLD THERAPY: Freezer safe roller provides cold therapy to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Ideal following activities that irritate the plantar fascia. 3. HEAT THERAPY: Use roller warm to provide heat therapy to help increase elasticity and blood flow to promote healing of the plantar fascia. Ideal prior to walking or standing. The roller is made of latex free Sorbothane® material which is firm, yet flexible and comfortable against the skin. When warmed or chilled, the roller maintains its density and stays flexible.

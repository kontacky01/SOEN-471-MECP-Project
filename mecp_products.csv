It is commonly used for cosmetic treatments, although it can also be used for therapeutic purposes. Dysport is a great option for both male and female patients aged 2 years and above. It can be used to treat a variety of ailments, including neurological disorders, bladder disorders, skin and skin appendage disorders, jaw clenching, teeth grinding, muscle spasms, wrinkles, and cervical dystonia. The solution works by blocking nerve signals to certain muscles, allowing them to relax and not contract. The effects typically last for 3 to 5 months after injection, depending on the patients lifestyle and physiology. While Dysport is generally safe to use, there are certain patients who should not use it, including those with pre-existing neuromuscular disorders or hypersensitivity to any of the components. Common side effects include localized pain, tenderness, swelling, and edema, while more severe but rare reactions include eye movement disorder, urticaria, hypersensitivity, and eyelid ptosis. Dysport should only be administered by qualified medical professionals, and recovery time typically involves avoiding makeup, overexposure to the sun, alcoholic beverages, and intensive sports for a few days. Extreme temperatures should also be avoided for up to 15 days after the procedure. Overall, Dysport is a safe and effective solution for treating wrinkles and muscle spasms. Whether used for cosmetic or therapeutic purposes, it has been proven to be effective and reliable for over 20 years.

81,Allergan Botox 100 Units,"Allergan Botox 100 unitsfrom Allergan is a botulinum type A medication. Allergan is a world-renowned pharmaceutical firm that exports high-quality dermal fillers to more than 100 countries. Their product has been thoroughly evaluated by a number of scientists, and the findings are astounding.Botoxis oneof the most common non-surgical cosmetic procedures, with over 6 million operations performed each year. People who wanted to get rid of facial flaws said this surgery was one of the most effective ways to slow down the aging process. What are the ingredients in Botox? Clostridium botulinum, a microbe present in the tissues of various mammals and fish species and produces a substance known as Botulinum toxin type A, is the major component of the medication. This substance when injected into the skin, acts as a muscle relaxant. Although bacterium has a paralyzing effect on the human body, it is nonetheless employed in medicine (under the circumstances of proper medical application). What Is Botox and How Does It Work? The nerve signals are blocked after a Botox injection. Because it relaxes human muscles, you wont be able to stretch the injection site. Unattractive creases and wrinkles are smoothed out this manner.Botoxhas a long-lasting effect, which is one of its advantages. The results take effect immediately and last as long as 3 to 6 months. The patient can choose to continue using the drug after the effects wear out. The amount of wrinkles usually decrease after each subsequent operation. This is because muscles are accustomed to being relaxed all of the time, and even when the injection effect wears off, they remain intact. Botox is a prescription drug that is injected into the skin or muscles of the patient. Its also used to treat neck pain caused by cervical dystonia, as well as some symptoms of underarm sweating. It also relieves overactive bladder symptoms, prevents persistent migraine headaches, eyelid spasms, and some eye muscle disorders. It is sometimes used by doctors to enhance the appearance of moderate and severe frown lines between the brows.",00023923201,499.00,https://mecp.ca/product/allergan-botox-100-units/,2024-03-13 22:29:39

209,Detecto WinDDE Dynamic Data Exchange,"Features WinDDE Server communicates with up to 20 weight indicators attached to a computer. Weight indicators may be connected using standard computer serial ports or via ethernet using TCP/IP. The weight and status of the weight indicators are made available to spreadsheets, databases, and industrial control applications by means of Dynamic Data Exchange, or NetDDE for networked computers. Weight and time stamp information may be automatically captured to Excel creating a new row of information for each stable weight above the threshold. Alternatively, the capture feature may be based on the indicator print button to capture a row of data each time the print key is pressed on the indicator.  Weight MonitoringIndustrial Control Software such as Rockwell RSView, Automation Direct, Lookout Direct, and spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel may be used. A spreadsheet cell, such as A1, shows continuously updating weight. The spreadsheet may show a continuously updating bar graph. Formulas in the spreadsheet may show a flashing indication if the weight exceeds or drops below certain levels. The WinDDE command for the spreadsheet to read weight is simply =windde|scale!wt Automatic Stable Weight Capture to Excel After a weight is placed on the scale and the indicator sees a stable weight, the weight is placed in a spreadsheet cell, such as A5. The operator removes the weight, and the procedure is repeated, but the weight value is placed in the next spreadsheet row, such as A6.Printer Port Capture to ExcelAfter a weight is placed on the scale, the operator at the indicator may press the Print key on the indicator. Instead of printing, the printout information from the indicator is sent to the computer. The computer sets the spreadsheet cells, such as E3 Gross Weight, F3 Tare Weight, G3 Net Weight, etc. The operator then may remove the weight, and the procedure is repeated, but the information is placed in the next spreadsheet row, such as E4, F4, G4, etc. Computer Data CollectionAfter a weight is placed on the scale, the operator may type information at the computer, such as an ID number to associate the weight. The computer stores the information in a database or spreadsheet. The operator then may remove the weight. With certain weight indicators, such as the Cardinal model 220, weight monitoring, automatic stable weight capture to Excel and printer port capture to Excel can be used simultaneously. Windows 2000 or XP must be used if more than ten indicators will be connected.  Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Wonderware InTouch, Automation Direct, Lookout Direct, and Rockwell Automation RSView are just a few of the well-known applications which can be used with WinDDE.",,0.00,https://mecp.ca/product/detecto-windde-dynamic-data-exchange/,2024-03-13 22:29:43

1035,"78 PediPac Immobilization Device with Case, W9"" X L48"" X H2""","The PediPac Immobilization Device is paramount when addressing pediatric patients in emergencies, presenting unique challenges for first responders. Although spinal injuries in children are uncommon, they can be life-threatening, necessitating specialized child immobilizer equipment like the PediPac. The risk of pediatric spinal injuries intensifies when the patient is in a state of panic, hindering their ability to follow instructions for remaining still while initial care is administered and the spine is immobilized. The choice of equipment plays a crucial role in pediatric spinal immobilization scenarios. FERNOs PediPac offers dedicated spinal immobilization and restraint designed specifically for children measuring 28-54 inches in height and weighing 20-90 lbs. (9 to 41 kg). Quick and flexible restraint is facilitated through cot-fastening loops and color-coded straps on the PediPac. The head support is meticulously crafted, considering the disproportionately large heads of small children, ensuring the neck remains immobile and the airway stays open. Sewn-in lifting handles at both ends of the PediPac make for convenient maneuvering in confined spaces. Furthermore, the PediPac seamlessly integrates with adult backboards and ambulance cots, eliminating the need to invest in additional cots. Key Features of the PediPac Immobilization Device: Adjustable head support. Ear openings. Individual leg restraints.

Once connected to the control unit, the flex circuit actively regulates its temperature to create a zone of perfect insulation  a condition where heat loss to the environment is eliminated. This allows the sensor to accurately measure and capture the core temperature of the patient. 3M Bair Hugger Temperature Monitoring Patient Sensor is placed on the patients forehead before surgery and is worn throughout the perioperative journey. Consistent temperature monitoring Accurate core temperature measurement Single-use Offers consistent performance as the sensor stays on the patient as it is disconnected from the sensor cable and reconnected at each point of care, eliminating the variability associated with clinician technique and use of multiple monitoring devices Compatible with all patient monitors that accept YSI-400 type input Latex-free   Non-invasive technique.

Single use thermometer has accurate readings (in Fahrenheit) in just seconds! Measures temperature orally or axillary (under-arm) via special adhesive strip that holds themselves in place in the axillary position. Each dot changes color from tan to blue at a specific temperature relative to the melting point of the specific chemical mixture in the dot. Once the wait time is complete, the temperature reading is permanently locked in.TempaDOTs accuracy is the same as, or better than, other thermometers commonly used in a healthcare setting. Each of the dots has its own formulated temperature point that fires at a specific temperature. When a dot fires, its color changes from brown to blue. The number of dots that fire is dependent upon the patients temperature. The last blue dot provides the accurate temperature reading.It is important to remember that axillary temperature readings are routinely lower than corresponding oral temperature readings.
